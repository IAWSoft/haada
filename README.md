# HAADA

## Introduction

*HAADA* is a PHP application made to allow easy management of tasks and incidences that may occur at your company.

This is an assignment that our teacher *Andreu* put for us for the sake of a good learning of the *PHP* language.

## Goal

Our main objective is to create a website that everyone can use to keep track of the tasks and incidences that come up day by day in a company or environment.

It will have user authentication, and every user will have a specific level of privileges.

We will use the collaborative tool ***Google Drive*** to create the documentation of the project. 
Also, we will use ***GitHub*** as our version control software.

## Non-functional requirements

We don't need to invest time in the graphical design of the application. A minimalist approach will be fine.
