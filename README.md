# HAADA

## Introduction

*HAADA* is a PHP application made to allow easy management of tasks and incidences that may occur at your company.

This is an assignment that our teacher *Andreu* put for us for the sake of a good learning of the *PHP* language.

## Goal

Our main objective is to create a website that everyone can use to keep track of the tasks and incidences that come up day by day in a company or environment.

It will have user authentication, and every user will have a specific level of privileges.

We will use the collaborative tool ***Google Drive*** to create the documentation of the project. 

We will also use ***GitHub*** as our version control software.

## Non-functional requirements

We don't need to invest time in the graphical design of the application. A minimalist approach will be fine.

## Description of the application

The first version of the application must provide the following functionalities:

### Welcome Screen

The ***welcome screen*** will be the first page to load. It will have a welcoming message and a form to log into the application. There will also be a link to register as a new user.

### Navigation Menu

The ***navigation menu*** will appear on every page as soon as the user is logged in, to allow an easy navigation between the different functionalities that we want to provide. This navigation menu will have the following elements:

- Create incidence
- View existing incidences
- Log out
